Blender addon that auto-shades Titanfall 2 characters in one click.

...maybe not one, but better than drag-and-drop all those images.

## Reference

The method to export models and textures comes from the below link:
+ https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/r2-ripping/model-ripping

The S/G-Shader comes from the above link, which links to here:
+ https://github.com/Wanty5883/Titanfall2/blob/master/tools/SG_Shader.blend

I only utilize those (especially `SG_Shader.blend`) to do auto shading. Credit where credit's due (literally).

## How to Use

> Refer to the [demo video](https://youtu.be/SeedlnG4aPs) for video guide.

### Shade Active Material (Folder)

You can **shade the material you chose by a material folder**.

1. Export all the necessary assets, according to [the guide](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/r2-ripping/model-ripping).
   + Model (.qt) from Titanfall VPK Tool and Crowbar
   + Material from Legion+
2. Import model in Blender
3. Select the material that you want to shade
   + Need to explicitly choose active material. `Outliner > Mesh > (that green triangle thingy) > Material`
4. `Right click (in 3D viewport) > Titanfall Shader > Shade Active Material (Folder)`
5. Choose the **folder** containing the texture image files.
   + This folder should be auto-generated by Legion+ as material export result.
   + The names of the images **SHOULD** be something like `hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01_ao.png`, instead of random name like `0x4a85a742e8e5dceb.png`.

For example, when shading Jack Cooper's body, the folder you choose should be `hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01/`, where it looks like this:
```
hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01
├── hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01_ao.png
├── hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01_cav.png
├── hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01_col.png
└── (...other images)
```

### Shade By Material Name Matching (Folder)

You can choose to **shade all materials in a mesh / armature at once**, given a folder containing the material folders.

1. Prepare all material folders exported from Legion+ in one folder
   + we call this the main folder. Note that main folder contains many subfolders, each of which is a material and contain some images
   + The addon will try to match the material name and subfolder names together
2. Select a mesh or armature
3. `Right click (in 3D viewport) > Titanfall Shader > Shade By Material Name Matching (Folder)`
4. Choose the main folder 
   + **DON'T choose the material folders; choose the folder CONTAINING those material folders**
5. Profit.

e.g. To shade Jack Cooper, prepare the folders like this:
```
jack_materials/
├── aquarium_interior_glass_01/
│   ├── aquarium_interior_glass_01_col.png
│   ├── aquarium_interior_glass_01_gls.png
│   └── (...other images)
├── hero_mil_jack_body_necklace_skn_02/
├── hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01/
├── hero_mil_jack_decal_skn_02/
└── (...other material folders)
```
where `jack_materials/` is the main folder we mentioned before.

Select `jack_materials/` in `Shade By Material Name Matching (Folder)`. **Make sure you select `jack_materials/`, not subfolders** like `jack_materials/aquarium_interior_glass_01/`.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues, **make an issue on Github** and **describe what you encounter as complete as possible**. Including posting **error messages, blender version and relevant file tree** (e.g. material folder).

Before you post an issue, you can **reinstall the addon with the newest version** and try again. Sometimes this helps.
