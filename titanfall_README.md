Blender addon that auto-shades Titanfall 2 characters in one click.

...maybe not one, but better than drag-and-drop all those images.

## Reference

The method to export models and textures comes from the below link:
+ https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/r2-ripping/model-ripping

The S/G-Shader comes from the above link, which links to here:
+ https://github.com/Wanty5883/Titanfall2/blob/master/tools/SG_Shader.blend

I only utilize those (especially `SG_Shader.blend`) to do auto shading. Credit where credit's due (literally).

## How to Use

> Refer to the [demo video](https://youtu.be/SeedlnG4aPs) for video guide.

1. Export all the necessary assets, according to [the guide](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/r2-ripping/model-ripping).
   + Model (.qt) from Titanfall VPK Tool and Crowbar
   + Material from Legion+
2. Import model in Blender
3. Select the material that you want to shade
   + Need to explicitly choose active material. `Outliner > Mesh > (that green triangle thingy) > Material`
4. `Right click (in 3D viewport) > Titanfall Shader > Shade Active Material (Folder)`
5. Choose the **folder** containing the texture image files.
   + This folder should be auto-generated by Legion+ as material export result.
   + The names of the images **SHOULD** be something like `hero_mil_jack_body_skn_01_ao.png`, instead of random name like `0x4a85a742e8e5dceb.png`.


## Issues

If you encounter any issues, **make an issue on Github** and **describe what you encounter as complete as possible**. Including posting **error messages, blender version and relevant file tree** (e.g. material folder).

Before you post an issue, you can **reinstall the addon with the newest version** and try again. Sometimes this helps.
